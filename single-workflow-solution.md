# Single Workflow Solution - No Bandaid Fixes

## Perfect! You're right - one workflow is cleaner.

### Option 1: Parallel Tasks in One Workflow (Recommended)
The .replit file already supports parallel mode. Here's the ideal configuration:

```toml
[[workflows.workflow]]
name = "Full Stack App"
mode = "parallel"
author = "user"

[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
task = "shell.exec"
args = "cd backend-project && npm run dev"
waitForPort = 5000

[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
task = "shell.exec"
args = "cd frontend-project && npm run dev"
waitForPort = 5173
```

### Option 2: Sequential Tasks (Alternative)
```toml
[[workflows.workflow]]
name = "Full Stack App"
mode = "sequential"
author = "user"

[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
task = "shell.exec"
args = "cd backend-project && npm run dev &"

[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
task = "shell.exec"
args = "cd frontend-project && npm run dev"
waitForPort = 5173
```

### Option 3: Shell Script Approach (Current)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd backend-project && npm run dev &
cd frontend-project && npm run dev &
wait
```

## Benefits of Single Workflow:
- ✅ One click to start everything
- ✅ Both projects run simultaneously
- ✅ No duplicate configurations
- ✅ Simpler management
- ✅ Clean separation maintained

## Implementation:
Since I can't modify .replit directly, you can:
1. Use the shell script approach (./start-both-projects.sh)
2. Or manually update the workflow configuration in Replit interface

Both backend and frontend remain completely independent!
