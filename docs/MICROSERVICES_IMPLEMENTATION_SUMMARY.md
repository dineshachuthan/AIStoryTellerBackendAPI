# Microservices Implementation Summary

## Phase 0: Foundation Setup ✅ (Completed)

### What We Built
1. **Base Microservice Adapter** (`server/microservices/base-microservice-adapter.ts`)
   - Provides table ownership validation
   - Extends existing storage patterns
   - Uses existing database with logical partitioning

2. **In-Memory Event Bus** (`server/microservices/event-bus.ts`)
   - Replaces Redis/Kafka for Replit environment
   - Global instance shared across adapters
   - Event logging for debugging
   - Support for wildcard event subscriptions

3. **Identity Service Adapter** (`server/microservices/identity-service-adapter.ts`)
   - Uses existing users, userProviders, localUsers tables
   - Publishes domain events for user actions
   - Maintains backward compatibility

4. **Auth Adapter Integration** (`server/microservices/auth-adapter-integration.ts`)
   - Integrates with existing authentication routes
   - Publishes events when enabled via ENABLE_MICROSERVICES=true
   - Zero impact when disabled (default)

### How It Works

1. **Monolith Mode (Default)**
   - ENABLE_MICROSERVICES=false (or not set)
   - System runs exactly as before
   - No events published, no overhead

2. **Microservices Mode**
   - ENABLE_MICROSERVICES=true
   - Events published for:
     - user.registered - When new user registers
     - user.login - When user logs in
     - user.updated - When user profile updates
     - user.oauth.linked - When OAuth provider linked

3. **Event Structure**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "user.registered",
     "serviceName": "monolith",
     "timestamp": "2025-01-16T15:30:00.000Z",
     "payload": {
       "userId": "local_123456789",
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "provider": "local"
     }
   }
   ```

### Testing the Integration

1. **Enable Microservices Mode**
   - Set `ENABLE_MICROSERVICES=true` in your environment

2. **View Event Log** (Admin only)
   - GET `/api/auth/events`
   - Shows last 20 events and current status

3. **Trigger Events**
   - Register new user → user.registered event
   - Login → user.login event
   - OAuth login → user.registered + user.oauth.linked events

### Next Steps (Phase 1)

1. **Complete Auth Route Integration**
   - Update OAuth callbacks to use auth adapter
   - Add user update event publishing
   - Add login tracking events

2. **Add Event Subscribers**
   - Identity adapter subscribes to subscription events
   - Future services can subscribe to user events

3. **Add Monitoring**
   - Event metrics endpoint
   - Event replay capability
   - Dead letter queue for failed events

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Zero Risk Migration**
   - Feature flag controls everything
   - Can disable instantly if issues arise
   - No changes to existing functionality

2. **Gradual Adoption**
   - Start with events only
   - Add subscribers as needed
   - Move logic piece by piece

3. **Replit Compatible**
   - No Docker required
   - No external services needed
   - Works within single process

4. **Production Ready Path**
   - Can switch to Redis/Kafka later
   - Event structure remains the same
   - Just change EventBus implementation
