## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE: NEVER HARDCODE ANYTHING**
- All functions must be data-driven and configurable
- No hardcoded return values or placeholder implementations
- Always implement proper data flow from backend to frontend
- Use configuration files and database-driven logic only
- Code breakage and exceptions are acceptable - no fallback logic allowed
- No convenience hardcoding under any circumstances
- Every function must connect to real data sources or fail authentically

**CRITICAL DATABASE RULE: ALWAYS VERIFY EXISTING SCHEMA BEFORE CHANGES**
- MANDATORY: Check existing database columns and structure before altering schema
- Use SQL queries to inspect current table structure: `SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'table_name'`
- Never assume column names or data types - verify what actually exists in the database
- Identify and resolve duplicate columns or naming inconsistencies before proceeding
- Understand the purpose of existing columns before adding new ones
- Follow principle: "Inspect first, understand second, then modify" for all database operations
- Database schema changes must be based on actual current state, not assumptions

**CRITICAL INTEGRATION RULE: MANDATORY TIMEOUT AND RETRY SPECIFICATIONS**
- ALL external API integrations MUST implement exactly 3 retry attempts before throwing exception
- Main thread operations MUST have 60-second timeout per attempt
- Worker thread/background operations MUST have 300-second timeout per attempt
- Implement exponential backoff between retries (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Never create infinite polling loops - always include bounded execution time
- Clear timeout handlers properly to prevent memory leaks
- External services include: OpenAI, ElevenLabs, video providers, email/SMS services, Twilio, SendGrid
- Background processing operations must have total bounded execution time with automatic cleanup
- All timeout and retry values must be configurable through config files, never hardcoded

**Responsive Design Requirements:**
- All components must be responsive and mobile-compatible by default
- No need to ask specifically for mobile compatibility - it's always required
- Components should automatically adjust to screen size and resolution dynamically
- Use responsive grid systems and breakpoints for optimal user experience across all devices
