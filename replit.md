# Collaborative Storytelling Platform

## Overview

This is a collaborative storytelling platform that enables users to create AI-powered stories with voice narration, collaborative features, and multi-modal content generation. The application was originally a monolithic full-stack project but has been separated into independent frontend and backend applications for better scalability and deployment flexibility.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

### Git Repository Configuration
- **GitHub Username**: dineshachuthan
- **Backend Repository**: AIStoryTellerBackendAPI
- **Frontend Repository**: AIStoryTellerFrontEnd
- **Default Branch**: main
- **Authentication**: Uses GITHUB_TOKEN from Replit secrets

### Git Push Commands
When user requests "push to git", execute these commands:

**Backend Push (from root directory):**
```bash
git push https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/dineshachuthan/AIStoryTellerBackendAPI.git main
```

**Frontend Push (from frontend-project directory):**
```bash
cd frontend-project && git push https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/dineshachuthan/AIStoryTellerFrontEnd.git main
```

**Push Both Projects:**
```bash
# Push backend
git push https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/dineshachuthan/AIStoryTellerBackendAPI.git main

# Push frontend
cd frontend-project && git push https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/dineshachuthan/AIStoryTellerFrontEnd.git main
```

## Dynamic Host Configuration

**Runtime Domain Detection**: Application dynamically detects its domain at startup
- Frontend: Uses `window.location.hostname` to determine current domain
- Backend: Uses `REPLIT_DOMAINS` environment variable when available
- Both frontend and backend construct URLs dynamically at runtime
- No hardcoded domains anywhere in the codebase

**Environment Configuration**:
- Uses `REPLIT_DOMAINS` environment variable for dynamic domain detection
- Frontend adapts to current browser domain automatically
- Backend constructs URLs from environment variables only
- Application adapts to any domain without code changes

## Development Philosophy

### API First Development - STRICTLY ENFORCED

**Core Principle**: The API specification is the single source of truth for all development.

**Mandatory Workflow**:
1. **API Design First**: All new features must start with OpenAPI/Swagger specification
2. **Specification Completeness**: Every endpoint must have complete request/response schemas before implementation
3. **Implementation Follows Spec**: Backend routes must match the API specification exactly
4. **Frontend Contracts**: Frontend development uses the API specification as the contract
5. **No Divergence**: Any changes to APIs must update the specification first, then implementation

**Quality Standards**:
- All endpoints must have complete Swagger documentation
- Request/response schemas must be detailed and accurate
- Parameter validation must match specification exactly
- Error responses must be documented and consistent
- Interactive testing must be available through Swagger UI

**Enforcement Rules**:
- Never implement endpoints without updating Swagger documentation first
- Never add functionality that isn't reflected in the API specification
- Always maintain specification-implementation synchronization
- All API changes require specification review and approval

### API Development Protocol - MANDATORY PROCESS

**When any API issue is found in the frontend project, follow this STRICT sequence:**

1. **Backend Project (`backend-project/`)**: 
   - Update OpenAPI specification in `openapi.yaml` first
   - Implement/fix the backend route in `routes.ts`
   - Ensure response format matches specification exactly

2. **Frontend Project (`frontend-project/`)**: 
   - Update client-api library in `src/lib/api-client.ts`
   - Add/fix the specific method in appropriate API client section
   - Ensure method signature matches OpenAPI specification

3. **UI Code Isolation**: 
   - UI components should be completely agnostic of backend/database
   - All backend communication goes through client-api library only
   - No direct API calls, database references, or backend logic in UI components

**Architecture Boundaries**:
- **UI Layer**: React components, pages, hooks - no backend awareness
- **API Layer**: `api-client.ts` - single point of backend communication
- **Backend Layer**: Express routes, database operations - serves API specification

**Violation Prevention**:
- UI code should never contain endpoint URLs, database queries, or backend logic
- All data fetching must go through `api-client.ts` methods
- Any backend changes require OpenAPI spec update first
- Client-api library acts as the contract enforcement layer

## System Architecture
