## Overview

This is a full-stack collaborative storytelling platform that enables users to create, analyze, and perform stories through AI-powered narrative analysis and voice-based roleplay. The application combines modern web technologies with AI services to provide an immersive storytelling experience.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Client-side routing with React components

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints with session-based authentication
- **File Handling**: Multer for multipart form data and file uploads
- **Audio Processing**: OpenAI TTS integration with custom voice matching system

### Database Layer
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe queries
- **Migration Management**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed session store using connect-pg-simple

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES (NEVER VIOLATE)

### Zero Tolerance Hardcoding Policy
**ABSOLUTELY NO HARDCODED TEXT, LABELS, BUTTONS, TITLES, TOOLTIPS, OR MESSAGES ANYWHERE IN THE CODEBASE**
- ALL user-facing text MUST use UIMessages internationalization system from shared/i18n-config.ts
- ALL configuration values MUST come from dedicated config files (shared/draft-config.ts, etc.)
- ALL database counts MUST be sourced from actual database queries
- VIOLATION OF THIS RULE IS UNACCEPTABLE - user has spent hours establishing these patterns
- When adding ANY text, immediately create corresponding i18n template with proper variables
- Pattern: `{UIMessages.getTitle('MESSAGE_CODE')}` or `{getDynamicMessage('CODE', variables).message}`

### Mandatory Architectural Patterns (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
- **BaseCachedProvider**: All external API integrations MUST use cached provider pattern
- **UIMessages I18N**: All text MUST use internationalization system with proper template interpolation
- **Plug-and-Play External APIs**: Zero fallback provider logic anywhere in system
- **Database-First Operations**: All data operations go to database first, then cache
- **State-Driven Workflow**: All story states use established state transition system
- **EnhancedVoiceRecorder**: FINALIZED as single reusable voice recording component - NEVER create copies or alternatives. All voice recording functionality across application uses this component with different props. Features: status icons (unlock/checkmark/lock), horizontal button layout (Record/Play/Save), wide black panel, intensity badges.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**MANDATORY ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS (ALWAYS FOLLOW):**
- **Caching Pattern**: All external API integrations must use the BaseCachedProvider architecture with infinite TTL content hashing - no direct API calls bypassing cache layer
- **Internationalization Pattern**: All user-facing text must use the UIMessages utility system with centralized message templates in i18n-config.ts - zero hardcoded strings in components
- **External API Integration Pattern**: All external services must follow the plug-and-play provider architecture with abstract base classes, configuration-driven initialization, and unified error handling

These patterns must be followed in all future work without explicit instruction.

**CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE: NEVER HARDCODE ANYTHING**
- All functions must be data-driven and configurable
- No hardcoded return values or placeholder implementations
- Always implement proper data flow from backend to frontend
- Use configuration files and database-driven logic only
- Code breakage and exceptions are acceptable - no fallback logic allowed
- No convenience hardcoding under any circumstances
- Every function must connect to real data sources or fail authentically

**CRITICAL APPROVAL RULE: NO SCHEMA/ENDPOINT CHANGES WITHOUT PERMISSION**
- DO NOT create or modify database schema without explicit approval
- DO NOT add new REST endpoints without explicit approval  
- DO NOT add new routes without explicit approval
- Always request permission before any structural changes to API or database
- Focus on using existing infrastructure and endpoints when possible

**CRITICAL FILE CREATION RULE: MANDATORY APPROVAL FOR ALL NEW FILES**
- DO NOT create any new code files without explicit user approval
- MUST explain the purpose, logic, and functionality that will be implemented in the new file
- MUST justify why existing files cannot accommodate the required functionality
- MUST get user confirmation before proceeding with file creation
- This rule applies to ALL file types: components, services, utilities, configurations, etc.
- Respect existing functionality - users may have spent significant time building features into existing files
- Always verify that all existing functionality is preserved when refactoring or creating new files

**CRITICAL PROVIDER RULE: NO FALLBACK PROVIDERS ANYWHERE**
- ZERO TOLERANCE for fallback provider logic in voice or video systems
- Only the configured primary provider should be used - no secondary options
- If primary provider fails, system must throw error - no automatic switching
- Remove all getFallbackProvider(), fallback logic, and provider switching code
- Configuration determines single active provider - no backup providers allowed
- System failures are acceptable - fallback providers are forbidden

**CRITICAL CACHE VS FALLBACK DISTINCTION: CACHE LOGIC IS ACCEPTABLE**
- **Cache Logic (NORMAL BUSINESS LOGIC)**: Read from cache → if cache miss/expired/dirty → go to source (database/file/API) → fetch data → re-cache with sliding expiration
- **Write Cache Logic (NORMAL)**: Delete cache key → write to database → insert new data into cache (all in one transaction)
- **Fallback Logic (FORBIDDEN)**: Hardcoding values, switching to different source systems, or switching to different providers when primary fails
- **KEY DISTINCTION**: Going to database when cache is invalid = normal caching, NOT fallback logic
- **FALLBACK DEFINITION**: Switching providers, using hardcoded alternatives, or using different source systems when primary system fails
- Cache-to-database reads are standard cache invalidation patterns and should NOT be removed as "fallback logic"

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE RULE: MANDATORY PLUG-AND-PLAY PATTERNS**
- ALL external integrations MUST follow identical plug-and-play architecture patterns
- Voice providers must use same abstract interfaces and patterns as video providers
- New providers added by implementing abstract base classes only - no custom integration logic
- Provider registries handle configuration-driven initialization and health checking
- Routes remain provider-agnostic - work with any enabled provider without code changes
- Configuration files control all provider behavior - no provider-specific hardcoded logic
- External integrations (ElevenLabs, Kling, RunwayML, OpenAI) follow identical patterns

**CRITICAL INTEGRATION RULE: STANDARDIZED EXTERNAL API EXCEPTION HANDLING**
- ALL external API failures MUST use ExternalIntegrationStateReset.logFailureWithoutStorage()
- NO completion records stored on external API failures - only error logging allowed
- External API timeouts automatically reset database states to 'failed' status
- Provider modules MUST extend BaseProvider abstract classes with standardized retry/timeout logic
- Exactly 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) before throwing exception
- All external integration failures logged with detailed context but no database persistence
- External services include: OpenAI, ElevenLabs, RunwayML, Kling, Twilio, SendGrid

**CRITICAL DATABASE RULE: ALWAYS VERIFY EXISTING SCHEMA BEFORE CHANGES**
- MANDATORY: Check existing database columns and structure before altering schema
- Use SQL queries to inspect current table structure: `SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'table_name'`
- Never assume column names or data types - verify what actually exists in the database
- Identify and resolve duplicate columns or naming inconsistencies before proceeding
- Understand the purpose of existing columns before adding new ones
- Follow principle: "Inspect first, understand second, then modify" for all database operations
- Database schema changes must be based on actual current state, not assumptions
- **CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: ALWAYS STOP THE APP BEFORE MAKING SCHEMA CHANGES** - prevents database conflicts and connection issues during migrations

**CRITICAL DATABASE-TO-REST MAPPING RULE: SCHEMA COLUMN CONSISTENCY**
- **MANDATORY SCHEMA VALIDATION**: Always cross-reference DATABASE_SCHEMA_ANALYSIS.md before modifying TypeScript schemas
- **COLUMN NAME MATCHING**: Database snake_case columns must exactly match TypeScript camelCase property names (user_voice_profile_id → userVoiceProfileId)
- **MISSING COLUMNS DETECTION**: Use comprehensive table analysis to identify missing columns in TypeScript schemas before deployment
- **DEFAULT VALUE CONSISTENCY**: Database default values must match TypeScript schema defaults (training_status: 'pending' vs 'collecting')
- **NULLABLE FIELD ALIGNMENT**: Database nullable fields must correspond to TypeScript optional properties with proper null handling
- **CRITICAL COLUMNS VERIFICATION**: Always verify critical columns exist in both database and schema (training_status, elevenlabs_voice_id, quality_score)
- **TYPE MAPPING ACCURACY**: Ensure PostgreSQL types correctly map to TypeScript types (jsonb → Json, varchar(50) → string, numeric → number)
- **FOREIGN KEY CONSISTENCY**: Reference columns must match between database foreign keys and TypeScript relations
- **INDEX OPTIMIZATION**: Database indexes must align with TypeScript query patterns and performance requirements
- **MIGRATION SAFETY**: Schema changes require verification that existing data remains accessible through new TypeScript definitions
- **ERROR PREVENTION**: Column mismatches cause runtime errors - prevent with mandatory pre-deployment schema comparison
- **REST API ALIGNMENT**: API endpoints must handle both database column names and TypeScript property names for backward compatibility

**CRITICAL INTEGRATION RULE: MANDATORY TIMEOUT AND RETRY SPECIFICATIONS**
- ALL external API integrations MUST implement exactly 3 retry attempts before throwing exception
- Main thread operations MUST have 60-second timeout per attempt
- Worker thread/background operations MUST have 300-second timeout per attempt
- Implement exponential backoff between retries (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Never create infinite polling loops - always include bounded execution time
- Clear timeout handlers properly to prevent memory leaks
- External services include: OpenAI, ElevenLabs, video providers, email/SMS services, Twilio, SendGrid
- Background processing operations must have total bounded execution time with automatic cleanup
- All timeout and retry values must be configurable through config files, never hardcoded

**CRITICAL CACHING RULE: COMPREHENSIVE CACHE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**
- **Environment-Specific Cache Directories**: Separate cache directories per environment (dev/staging/production)
- **Configurable Size Limits**: 500MB dev, 5GB production for audio cache with automatic cleanup
- **TTL Management**: 30-day default TTL with configurable expiration per cache type
- **Cache-First Architecture**: Always check cache before external API calls to minimize costs
- **Database-First Caching**: Write database records BEFORE file save to ensure data integrity
- **Content Hash Keys**: Use SHA256 content hashing for cache keys to prevent duplicate generation
- **Automatic Cleanup Jobs**: Scheduled cleanup of expired cache files with size threshold management
- **Cache Invalidation System**: WebSocket-based real-time cache invalidation across clients
- **Usage Statistics Tracking**: Track cache hit rates, file sizes, and usage patterns
- **Multiple Cache Types**: audio-cache, image-cache, analysis-cache, story-cache with specialized handling
- **Metadata Storage**: Store cache metadata (generation time, usage count, file size) alongside cached data
- **Cleanup API Endpoints**: Manual cache cleanup endpoints for admin management
- **Cost Optimization**: Cache prevents duplicate external API calls to expensive services (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, video providers)

**CRITICAL HIERARCHICAL STORAGE RULE: USER-BASED CONTENT ORGANIZATION**
- **MANDATORY HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE**: All user content must follow user-data/{userId}/{contentType}/{category}/{identifier}/sample-{n}.{ext} structure
- **USER-ID ISOLATION**: Every file must be stored under user-specific directory to prevent cross-user access and data conflicts
- **SAMPLE VERSIONING SUPPORT**: Use sample-1.mp3, sample-2.mp3, etc. for multiple recordings per emotion/intensity combination
- **IDENTIFIER SUBDIRECTORIES**: Group related samples under identifier folders (e.g., joy-8, anger-6, story-123) for organized collection
- **DATABASE PATH CONSISTENCY**: Database columns store relative paths that dynamically build to full hierarchical URLs
- **DYNAMIC PATH BUILDING**: Frontend fetches use logged-in user ID to construct proper /api/user-content/{userId}/audio/emotions/{emotion}-{intensity}/sample-{n}.mp3 URLs
- **NO TIMESTAMP FOLDERS**: Avoid date/time folders - use sample numbering for chronological ordering and easy cleanup
- **FUTURE MVP READINESS**: Structure supports collecting multiple voice samples per emotion for improved voice cloning quality
- **CROSS-USER SECURITY**: Hierarchical structure prevents users from accessing other users' voice recordings or content
- **CLEANUP FRIENDLY**: Easy to remove old samples by targeting specific sample numbers while preserving recent recordings
- **STORY NARRATION STORAGE**: Story narrator files stored in user-data/{userId}/audio/stories/{storyId}/segment-{n}.mp3 following hierarchical structure
- **UNIFIED AUDIO ARCHITECTURE**: All audio content (voice samples, story narrations, generated audio) follows same hierarchical user-based storage pattern

**CRITICAL FORMAT DETECTION RULE: SIGNATURE-BASED AUDIO/VIDEO FORMAT HANDLING**
- **NO HARDCODED FILE EXTENSIONS**: All format detection must use buffer signature analysis from shared/audio-config.ts and shared/video-format-config.ts
- **MP3-Only Optimization**: System enforces MP3 format for ElevenLabs with automatic conversion skipping when files are already MP3
- **Dynamic Format Detection**: Use detectAudioFormat() and detectVideoFormat() functions instead of assuming extensions
- **Configuration-Driven Processing**: All format signatures, thresholds, and supported formats centralized in config files
- **Preferred Format Hierarchies**: WAV, MP4, OGG preferred for recording before WebM fallback
- **MediaRecorder Capability Checking**: Recording format selection based on MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported() browser capabilities
- **Buffer Content Analysis**: Format detection analyzes actual file buffer content (RIFF, ID3, ftyp, EBML signatures) not filename extensions
- **FFmpeg EBML Error Prevention**: Proper format detection prevents treating MP3 files as WebM which causes FFmpeg parsing failures
- **Web-Safe Format Validation**: Only MP4/WebM for video, MP3/WAV/OGG for audio with compatibility matrix checking
- **Format Conversion Optimization**: Skip unnecessary conversions when source format matches target requirements
- **Audio Processing Pipeline**: WAV → MP3 conversion pipeline with format preservation when possible
- **Video Quality Management**: MP4 high quality for web, WebM for compatibility, with automatic resolution selection

**Responsive Design Requirements:**
- All components must be responsive and mobile-compatible by default
- No need to ask specifically for mobile compatibility - it's always required
- Components should automatically adjust to screen size and resolution dynamically
- Use responsive grid systems and breakpoints for optimal user experience across all devices
